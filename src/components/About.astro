            Hi! My name is Carlos Manuel Gonz√°lez and I'm Computer Science Student at the University of Havana.
            I really love running and going out with my friends. I'm very curious and keep in continuous learning about the things that I like.
            I'm passionate about web development, cryptocurrencies and machine learning, but currently I'm enfoced on web development.
            I started programming when have 16 years old in the competitive programming. I have been 3 years focused only on that and participated in many national and international competitions from my preuniversity.
            When I ingresed in the university I started to interest more in web development, and I come to develop applications both frontend and backend.
